# 🩺 AI-based Diagnostic Tool for Medical Image Analysis

## Problem Statement 💡

This project aims to develop an **AI-based diagnostic tool** that can analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to assist doctors in detecting diseases like **cancer**, **pneumonia**, or **fractures** more accurately and swiftly.

## Key Features 🚀
- 🖼️ **Medical Image Processing**: Supports X-rays, MRI, and CT scans for efficient diagnosis.
- 🏥 **Disease Detection**: AI identifies critical conditions like cancer, pneumonia, and fractures.
- ⚡ **Increased Accuracy**: Helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses.
- 🤖 **Automated Analysis**: Uses machine learning models to analyze medical images automatically.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. 🏥 **Input**: Upload medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans).
2. 🧠 **AI Analysis**: The AI processes the images and detects patterns/anomalies.
3. 🔬 **Diagnosis**: The tool highlights potential issues for doctor review.
4. 📝 **Final Review**: Doctors verify and finalize diagnoses based on AI recommendations.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- 🖼️ **Image Processing**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- 🔧 **Backend**: Python, Flask / Django
- 🖥️ **Frontend** (optional): React / Angular for visualization

## Setup Instructions 📦

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NiksheyYadav/ai-medical-diagnostic-tool.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Upload medical images**: Use the provided interface to upload medical images and receive AI-powered analysis.

## Future Improvements 🌟
- 🏥 Support additional medical imaging types.
- 🧠 Enhance the detection of more diseases.
- 🔄 Improve model performance with larger datasets.
- 📝 Incorporate doctor feedback loops for continuous learning and validation.
