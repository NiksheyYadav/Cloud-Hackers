# AI-based Diagnostic Tool for Medical Image Analysis

## Problem Statement

The project aims to develop an AI-based diagnostic tool capable of analyzing medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to assist doctors in detecting diseases like cancer, pneumonia, or fractures with greater accuracy and speed.

## Key Features
- **Medical Image Processing**: Supports various types of medical imaging such as X-rays, MRI, and CT scans.
- **Disease Detection**: Helps identify critical conditions like cancer, pneumonia, and fractures.
- **Increased Accuracy**: Assists doctors in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.
- **Automated Analysis**: Uses machine learning models to automatically analyze medical images.

## How It Works
1. Medical images are input into the system.
2. The AI processes these images, identifying patterns and anomalies.
3. The tool highlights potential areas of concern for further investigation by doctors.
4. Doctors can review AI-detected issues to confirm or reject diagnoses.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- **Backend**: Python, Flask / Django
- **Frontend**: React / Angular (optional for visualization)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-medical-diagnostic-tool.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Upload medical images through the interface and get AI-powered analysis results.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate more types of medical imaging.
- Expand disease detection capabilities.
- Improve the model's performance with a larger dataset.
- Add doctor feedback loops for enhanced learning and validation.
